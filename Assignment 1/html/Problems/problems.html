                    <h1>Youth Violence Causes and Problems</h1>

                        <br />
                            <h3>Some causes of Youth Violence:</h3>

                        <ul class="well text-left">
                                <br>
                                <li>The insecurity amongst Caribbean citizens accounts for alot of youth violence. It has stemmed from inadequate attention given to youths for both development and empowerment.These have increased the risk of youth offences and vitimizaition drastically.
                                </li>
                                <br>

                                <li>Verbal and Physical abuse at home may lead to violence such as, the physical and psychological abuse of classmates and teachers.
                                </li>
                                <br>

                                <li>Vitimization has contributed to the formation of delinquent groups and gangs in schools as students seek to defend themselves. Gang formation is most likely to occur at the Secondary Schools. It may be a form of protection, ie. a security response. School gangs are generally defensive even if they share characteristics of street gangs.
                                </li>
                                <br>

                                <li>Exposure to community violence is also a main cause of youth violence. It can stem from being direct victim of violence, or indirectly as a witness. The use of violence may be beacause of fear amongst youth, ie, worry of child abuse, rape, robbery, unemployment and lack of road safety etc.
                                </li> 
                                <br>

                                      <p>The prominence of youth violence as a Caribbean developmental concern is not surprising given the fact that 64 percent of the population of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) consists of young people under 30 years of age, while 30 percent of the population is between 18 and 30 years of age.2 Even the specific youth category of 15-24 yearolds represents significant proportions (around one fifth) of national populations of the countries selected as research sites for this report Thus, there is a logical expectation that gains in Caribbean human development will depend heavily on the well-being and contribution of the youth population. At the same time, any increase in violence among youth, however marginal, will have a significant impact on society, including increased fear and insecurity among youth and other citizens. The prevention of youth violence is therefore an imperative for human development.

                                      <p>In the context of the survey, only 1.6 percent of youth between 18 and 24 years of age had been accused or arrested for violent crimes involving the use of weapons, and only 2.5 percent for violent crimes without weapons. The variations across countries are highlighted in the table. The variations across countries are highlighted in the table. The highest proportions of reported youth violence occurred in Saint Lucia (2.7 percent with weapons and 4.3 without), followed by Guyana (1.4 percent with weapons and 4.2 percent without), Trinidad and Tobago (3 percent with weapons, and 2.6 percent without) and Barbados (4 percent with weapons, and 1.3 percent without), despite the country's reputation for low levels of violent crime. Not with standing Jamaica's regional and international reputation for relatively high levels of violence, the proportion of Jamaican youth survey respondents who reported they had been accused or arrested for violent crimes was low (0 percent with weapons, and 1.9 percent without). It should be noted, though, that, in absolute terms, the actual number of cases in all countries was small.                                        </p>

                                                <p>Unemployment is the number one problem according to youth in five of the Caribbean-7; in Saint Lucia and in Trinidad and Tobago, violent crime was the top concern of the majority of youth respondents to the survey. In the Caribbean countries in 2004, the youth unemployment rate (among 15-24-yearolds) was higher than the overall unemployment rate: 34.0 percent in Jamaica; 25.4 percent in Trinidad and Tobago; 44.0 percent in Saint Lucia; and 21.8 percent in Barbados.22 Among the youth surveyed, 8.6 percent were unskilled labourers, while 18.8 percent had never been employed. Over 20 percent of the youth surveyed indicated that they did not have enough income to live comfortably or to cover basic needs. The emotional frustration arising from the social exclusion associated with unemployment or low income has been linked to aggression among youth and may motivate violent crimes such as homicide.23

                                                <p>Low levels of educational achievement have also been identified as a socio-economic risk factor for the involvement in violence.24 Access to education at the primary level is close to universal in the Caribbean, and young people have good access to education at higher levels.However, concerns remain about the increasing rates of school drop-outs and declining levels of educational attainment, particularly among boys. Data of the Caribbean Examinations Council show that overall pass rates in the basic subjects of mathematics and English at the secondary school level have declined and declined more significantly among boys.25 On average between 1997 and 2009, the pass rate in mathematics fell by over 8.0 percent among boys and by about 2.5 percent among girls, even though boys had higher pass rates.26 Over the same period, in English, the pass rates declined by over 13.0 percent among boys and by 12.5 percent among girls (girls had the higher pass rates). Overall, the average pass rates among boys and girls in 2009 were low in both subjects (around 35 percent for mathematics and around 55 percent for English). These outcomes are worrisome given the acknowledged correlation between declining educational achievement and increasing levels of violence in society.27 Departure from school without the requisite skills and abilities increases the likelihood of youth exposure to and experience of other risk factors, including higher levels of unemployment, teen pregnancy, risky sexual activity and substance abuse, which contribute to other problem behaviours among youth. The early departure of boys from school certainly contributes to the male-on-male character of violence in the Caribbean. On the one hand, school drop-out rates suggest that educational institutions do not meet student expectations. On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge other factors that may impinge on the capacity of students to tinue schooling. The lack of financial support for studies, school closures due to violence, and inability to concentrate because of environmental conditions, including community violence, may all contribute to students dropping out, making them even more vulnerable to recruitment into violent activity.

                Youth at risk are described as those young people who “face environmental, social and family conditions that may hinder their personal development and successful integration into society as productive citizens."19 Youth become vulnerable if they are exposed to these hindrances, which are multidimensional and emerge from various levels of the social experience of the youth population. In the Caribbean, some of the most vulnerable youth are living on the streets, in group homes or correctional facilities, or they are living on their own because they have been orphaned, neglected, or left unsupervised by parents who have migrated or been incarcerated. These young people are among those individuals likely to become involved in criminal or violent offending.

                In general, the risks that may increase the likelihood of youth involvement in violence may be grouped in three main categories: societal; community, including interpersonal; and individual. The factors are often interrelated in a complex web of risk and vulnerability. They may include unemployment, societal or community tolerance of violence, illegal drug use and trafficking, gang activity, disconnection from or poor attitudes towards school and low educational attainment, and lack of effective and caring parenting.
