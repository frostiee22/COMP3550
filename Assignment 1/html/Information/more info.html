                                 <h3>Youth Involvement in Violent Crime</h3>
			<p>
			Youth crime and violence in the Caribbeanhave been characterized as a phenomenon pitting youth against youth and male against male and have been closely linked to the emergence of criminal gangs. Notwithstanding the youth-on-youth profile of youth crime, youth who use violence are a minority of the youth population.
			</p>
			<p>
			The country studies and the findings of the UNDP Citizen Security Survey 2010 highlight that, while young people are involved in serious crimes, most of the activities they undertake that violate the law or social norms are not serious or violent. Nonetheless, it is also likely that episodes of youth violence may be underreported for a variety of reasons. These include community tolerance and acceptance of some non-criminal violent behaviour, a desire to keep youth out of criminal justice systems, and a lack of confidence that authorities will respond if crimes are reported. It is also true that crime data hide other forms of delinquent behaviour. However, there is sufficient evidence in the country studies and the survey to suggest that violent behaviour is not prevalent or endemic among the youth populations of the region. In the context of overall youth behaviour in the Caribbean, reliance on violence is uncommon.
			</p>
			<p>
			In fact, most youth who come into contact with the police and the justice system are not involved in violent crimes, but have run away from home or are associated with behaviour indicating a desperate need for care and protection following abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Such â€˜status offencesâ€™, which are not considered criminal if they are committed by adults, often bring children and youth into conflict with the law.
			</p>
		                          <h3>The Impact of Youth Violence on Caribbean Human Development</h3>
			<p> Notwithstanding its exceptional nature, youth violence poses a challenge for human development. Indeed, displays of violence among youth create a risk that patterns of persistent violent behaviour will emerge and, once entrenched, affect the future of society. The sheer number of youth in the region has meant that youth crime and violence have already had several negative influences on all sectors of society.14 The direct monetary costs to governments and citizens of corrective measures include budgetary expenditure on security, policing, judicial processing, and incarceration, in addition to private security expenditure by businesses and individuals. The indirect monetary and economic costs include loss of earnings of incarcerated youth, loss of life among young productive citizens, lower economic growth and reduced tourism revenues.

			Although Caribbean youth aspire to lead honourable and productive lives and to experience a good standard of living, they are vulnerable to several factors that erode their capacity to achieve their personal, professional and social goals and predispose them to significant risk of becoming perpetrators or victims of acts of violence.
			Youth at risk are described as those young people who â€œface environmental, social and family conditions that may hinder their personal development and successful integration into society as productive citizens.

                                    <p>Given the significance of youth in the Caribbean region, there is a need to develop effective approaches to preventing youth violence. An understanding of the challenge of youth violence in the Caribbean should lead to acceptance of the fact that strategies for reducing youth violence must tackle the context in which violence arises, while carving out a space for youth to be equipped to take responsibility for resisting the recourse to violence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Certainly, the reduction of risk factors is also likely to contribute to the enhancement of youth resilience. For example, a reduction in the exposure to violence eliminates the stress, frustration and trauma that would otherwise prevent youth from coping with periodic socio-economic stressors in their environments. The reduction of risk and the enhancement of youth resilience are therefore inextricably linked. The attention to one to the detriment of the other is likely to reduce the effectiveness of policies and programmes on violence prevention.
			</p>
		<h3>Reducing Risk and Vulnerability</h3>
			<p>The concern about increasing levels of youth violence has led to the mobilization of support and resources for many youth development programmes at various levels across the region. These programmes are mounted by a variety of actors, including governments, civil society organizations, the private sector, community associations and faith-based organizations. The following
six themes are presented as the foundations
of good practice.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The contextualization of programmes for violence prevention among youth as aspects of a broader project of societal development is imperative. Programmes must address community risk factors, as well as the national and regional contexts for development, including unemployment, political corruption, gang violence and organized crime, government inefficiency, and the low penetration of public services.</li>
				<li>The principle of inclusivity should be applied in age- and gender-targeted interventions. socialization.</li>
				<li>Initiatives need to be tailored to different stages of the life cycle by integrating all levels and involving all categories of youth, including youth who are at risk, good youth, offenders, and school drop-outs. Everyone deserves a second chance, and good youth should not be neglected. </li>
				<li>Integrated planning and programmes are most effective. For example, linking drug abuse counselling to anger management, entrepreneurship and skills training at the community level on a voluntary and demand-driven basis helps address all levels of risk in a holistic, coordinated manner.</li>
				<li>Coordination and partnership among intergovernmental, governmental and civil society stakeholders is imperative and must support youth-adult partnerships. There is a general perception that civil society programmes are more effective even though the majority of programmes are run by the state. The effectiveness could be due to the fact that civil society organizations are more likely to involve young people in the planning and implementation process so as to understand more fully the context in which youth function.</li>
				<li>Strengthened police-youth relations, including police outreach in schools, are likely to provide a good foundation for social violence prevention. These kinds of voluntary partnerships among social institutions may contribute to encouraging law-abiding behaviour.</li>
				<li>The provision of specific alternatives for offenders and second-chance programmes for school drop-outs help lower youth risk and reduce the funnelling of youth unnecessarily into the criminal justice system.</li>

			</ol>
		<h3>Enhancing Youth Resilience</h3>
			<p>While the context for development must change through the reduction of exogenous risks, any violence prevention programme must also acknowledge the role that youth themselves must play in the process. In the Caribbean, youth are willing to participate in enhancing citizen security. The youth respondents to the UNDP Citizen Security Survey 2010 displayed strong feelings about participation in community violence prevention programmes. Stakeholders need to enable youth to play a role in violence reduction and prevention. Resilience involves positive adaptation under stress and the development of good outcomes despite serious threats to wellbeing</p>
			
		<h3>Factors Supporting Risk Reduction and Resilience-Building</h3>
			<p>In addition to observance of the six planning and programme principles outlined above, a contributory factor in achieving the twopronged approach to violence prevention is the mobilization of protective institutions to achieve the interconnected objectives of risk reduction and resilience-building. The protective institutions that influence young peopleâ€™s decision-making with respect to risktaking have been widely discussed in the literature. They may be distilled into four main spheres of influence: the family, peers, the community (including schools), and state institutions. These spheres correspond and relate to several societal and community risk factors. Therefore, the mobilization of each of these spheres of influence into positive action is likely to contribute to both risk reduction and resilience-building.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>The family:</em> Families, particularly parents, play an important role in shielding youth from some of the societal and community risk factors they encounter.48 The socialization of the child away from violent conflict is an important tool in promoting more socially positive behaviours at school and in the community. Close, stable and positive family connections and positive, supportive and non-violent relationships with parents who provide supervision and discipline are the linchpins of youth resilience, particularly among children under 16 years of age, although the provision of basic needs in care and protection, including food and shelter, is essential.</li>
				<li><em>Peer support groups:</em> Participation in clubs, associations and other peer groups may help prevent youth violence. Positive influences have been as effective in persuading youth away from violence as negative influences have been effective in pushing youth towards violence.</li>
				<li><em>The community:</em> Schools, community groups and faith-based organizations also play a role in the protection of youth and in building their resilience.</li>
				<li><em>State institutions:</em> A significant share of the initiatives aimed at reducing violence have been launched by state institutions, which also play a role in protection and resilience-building. Typically, the police, criminal justice systems and social departments and ministries have had the greatest access to young people.</li>

                            <p>The risk of violent offending and violent victimization among young people has increased. This has occurred in a context of high levels of youth unemployment, inadequate educational opportunities, and exposure to violence at home, in schools, in communities and in the wider society. At the same time, youth continue to express feelings of exclusion from national and regional governance processes, which helps predispose them to participate in alternative structures, including gangs.
			</p> 
			<p> While the problem of youth violence warrants urgent attention, exaggeration of the problem, particularly through anecdotes reported in the media, may serve to stereotype youth, particularly young males. Stereotyping contributes to the adoption of heavy-handed and rights-violating security responses that foster youth exclusion and unnecessary institutionalization through the criminal justice system.
			</p>
			<p> Nonetheless, all instances of youth violence, however small in proportion to the incidence of violence generally, should be taken seriously. Responses must address the structural, societal, community, and individual risk factors that account for youth violence and victimization. These responses should take into consideration country-specific contexts and gender differences in the patterns of offending and victimization.
