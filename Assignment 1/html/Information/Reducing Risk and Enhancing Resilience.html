                    <p> Youth violence has become an important development challenge worldwide. Because of the declining social and economic development conditions the risk that youth will become violent offenders and victims of violence has increased. Youth violence is more than a security problem; it is a major human development problem. The prominence of youth violence as a developmental concern is not surprising given that 64% of the population of the CARICOM consists of young people and 30% between 18 and 30 years.
	Caribbean governments have pledged their commitment to preventing youth violence through the World Plan of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond. However, the increase in reported violence suggests that policy has failed to address the issues of youth and violence.
	The UNDP 2010 survey showed that, while young people are involved in serious crimes, most activities that violate the law are not serious. It is also likely that youth violence may be underreported.
	Most youths who come into contact with the police are not involved in violent crimes, but have run away from home or show signs of need for care and protection following abuse, or abandonment.
Patterns associated with youth violence:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Youth violence has a gender dimension</li>
	<li>Violence among pre-adolescents is a growing concern</li> 
	<li>School violence has escalated</li> 
	<li>Youth violence is often a response to the threat and fear of victimization</li>
	<li>Youth violence is associated with community violence</li>
	<li>Youth victimization by peers and adults creates an environment for more violence</li>
</ul> 
		<p>Youth violence poses a challenge for human development. The number of youth in the region has meant that youth crime and violence have had negative influences on all sectors of society.
Youth become vulnerable if exposed to social conditions that hinder their personal development, which are multidimensional and emerge from various levels of experience. Some of the most vulnerable live on the streets or on their own.
Given the significance of youth in the Caribbean, there is a need to develop effective approaches to preventing youth violence. In order to prevent violence, first an understanding of the problem needs to be accurate. On one hand, there is a need to address the fundamental issues and on the other hand, youth needs to be equipped with enhanced agency as so to prevent and reverse trends towards crime.
The reduction of risk and the enhancement of youth resilience are therefore inextricably linked. The attention to one and the detriment to the other is likely to reduce the effectiveness of policies on violence prevention. 
Some methods to reduce the risk of youth violence:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Contextualization of programmes for violence prevention among youths as aspects of a broader project is imperative.</li>
	<li>The principle of inclusivity should be applied in age and gender targeted interventions. Initiatives need to be tailored to different stages of the life cycle. </li>
	<li>Integrated planning and programmes are most effective.</li>
	<li>Coordination and partnership among intergovernmental stakeholders is needed and must support youth-adult partnerships.</li>
	<li>Strengthened police-youth relations including police outreach at schools</li>
	<li>The provision of specific alternatives for offenders and second chance programmes for school dropouts.</li>
</ol>

	<p>Any violence prevention programme must acknowledge the role that the youth must play in the process. Stakeholders need to enable youth to play a role in violence reduction and prevention. Resilience involves positive adaption under stress and the development of good outcomes despite threats.
Factors Supporting Risks
The process of strengthening protective factors has been achieved to a varying extent through interventions for youth violence prevention.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Family</li>
	<li>Peer support group</li>
	<li>Community</li>
	<li>State institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>While the problem of youth violence warrants urgent attention, the problem is exaggerated through media and stereotypes youths, mainly males. Nevertheless, all youth violence should be taken seriously. Interventions aimed at reducing violence must acknowledge the rights of youth to participate.</p>
